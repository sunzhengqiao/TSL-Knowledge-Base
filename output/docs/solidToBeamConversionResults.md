# solidToBeamConversionResults.mcr

## Overview
This script serves as a diagnostic visualization tool used after a failed Solid-to-Beam conversion. It allows you to inspect the original imported 3D solid and specifically highlights the "bad faces" that the engine could not process, helping you identify where geometry needs to be modified.

## Usage Environment
| Space | Supported | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Model Space | Yes | Script must be inserted or generated in Model Space. |
| Paper Space | No | Not supported. |
| Shop Drawing | No | Not supported. |

## Prerequisites
- **Required Entities**: A script instance of this file.
- **Data Context**: This script relies on an internal data map (usually generated by a previous conversion process) containing the `bodyOriginal` and `BadFace` data. If run manually without this context, it may only display the status text.

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Launch Script
Command: `TSLINSERT` → Select `solidToBeamConversionResults.mcr`

### Step 2: Identify Status
```
Result: The script inserts at the selected point.
Display: A text label "Bad faces!" appears in Red at the insertion point, indicating conversion errors are present at this location.
```

### Step 3: Diagnose Geometry
Use the Right-Click Context Menu (detailed below) to toggle visualizations of the original body or the specific error faces.

## Properties Panel Parameters
There are no user-editable properties exposed in the Properties Palette for this script.

## Right-Click Menu Options

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Visualize original body** | Draws the full wireframe of the original imported solid in **Green**. Use this to verify the overall geometry shape matches your expectations. |
| **Visualize bad faces** | Draws only the specific faces that caused the conversion to fail in **Red**. Use this to pinpoint exactly which surfaces are non-planar or too complex for the timber beam engine. |
| **Recalculate** | Resets the view to the standard status display (the "Bad faces!" text). |

## Settings Files
No specific settings files are required for this script.

## Tips
- **Color Coding**: Remember that **Green** represents the valid/total original geometry, while **Red** represents the specific problematic areas you need to fix.
- **Workflow Integration**: This script is typically auto-generated by other import tools. If inserting it manually, ensure it is placed at the exact location of the failed solid to access the correct data map.

## FAQ
- **Q: I inserted the script but don't see any geometry, only text.**
  - A: This script requires internal data (`Map`) to be present from a prior conversion process. If that data is missing (e.g., you inserted the script in a blank drawing), the geometry cannot be displayed.
- **Q: How do I fix the "Bad faces"?**
  - A: Use the "Visualize bad faces" option to see them in red. You will likely need to go back to your original CAD software (e.g., AutoCAD, Revit) and simplify or split those specific surfaces so they are planar before re-importing.
- **Q: How do I get rid of the green/red wireframes?**
  - A: Right-click the script and select **Recalculate**. This will clear the wireframes and revert the display to the text label.

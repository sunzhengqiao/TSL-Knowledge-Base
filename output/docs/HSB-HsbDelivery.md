  "documentation": "# HSB-HsbDelivery\n\n## Overview\nThis script creates and manages delivery batches (shipments) within your timber project. It groups floor elements into specific deliveries, updates element quantities, and generates a visual table in Model Space for production drawings and database integration.\n\n## Usage Environment\n\n| Space | Supported | Notes |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Model Space | Yes | The script instance and visual table are placed here. |\n| Paper Space | No | Not supported in layouts. |\n| Shop Drawing | No | This is a model management script, not a detailing tool. |\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Required Entities**: Floor Groups (must meet specific naming rules) and Elements inside those groups.\n- **Minimum Beam Count**: 0 (This script works with Elements, not necessarily structural beams).\n- **Required Settings Files**:\n  - `hsbTslDelivery.dll` located in `hsbCAD\\Custom\\CDDelivery\\`. This is required for the editing interface.\n\n## Usage Steps\n\n### Step 1: Launch Script\nCommand: `TSLINSERT` → Select `HSB-HsbDelivery.mcr` from the list.\n\n### Step 2: Define Delivery Details\nA dialog will appear automatically during insertion.\n- **Action**: Enter a **Delivery Name** (e.g., \"Truck 1\") and a **Description**. Click OK.\n\n### Step 3: Placement\n```\nCommand Line: |Select a point|\nAction: Click anywhere in the Model Space to place the delivery list origin.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Configure Content (External Interface)\n- **Action**: After placement, an external dialog window (.NET) will open. Use this interface to select which Floor Groups belong to this delivery and set the quantity for each element.\n- **Action**: Save and Close the external dialog. The script will generate the visual table and update the model.\n\n## Properties Panel Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| Dimension style | Dropdown | (Current DimStyle) | Selects the CAD dimension style to control the text font and size in the table. |\n| Delivery name | Dropdown | (Empty) | Selects the active delivery batch to view or manage. Changing this updates the entire table and element quantities. |\n| Delivery description | Text | (Empty) | Displays a description of the current delivery. (Read-only; edit via Right-Click menu). |\n| Hide when amount is '0' | Dropdown | \\|No\\| | If set to \\|Yes\\|, items with a quantity of 0 are hidden in the visual table. |\n| Color table | Number | -1 | Sets the color for the table grid lines (-1 = ByBlock). |\n| Color content | Number | 5 | Sets the color for the text inside the table. |\n\n## Right-Click Menu Options\n\n| Menu Item | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Create a new delivery | Initializes a new delivery map, gathers current model data, and opens the external dialog to define the batch. |\n| Edit the current delivery | Opens the external dialog for the currently selected delivery, allowing you to modify quantities and assignments. |\n\n## Settings Files\n- **Filename**: `hsbTslDelivery.dll`\n- **Location**: `_kPathHsbInstall + \\Custom\\CDDelivery\\`\n- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for assigning elements to deliveries and editing quantities.\n\n## Tips\n- **Group Naming**: Ensure your Floor Groups follow the project naming convention required for delivery containers, otherwise, they will not appear in the external selection list.\n- **Switching Deliveries**: You can switch between different deliveries (e.g., Truck 1 vs. Truck 2) simply by changing the \"Delivery name\" property in the Properties Palette without running the script again.\n- **Clean Drawings**: Use the \"Hide when amount is '0'\" option to keep your production drawings clean by removing rows for items not included in the specific shipment.\n\n## FAQ\n- **Q: Why did the script disappear immediately after I placed it?**\n  A: You likely tried to insert a second delivery instance on a Floor Group that already has one. The script prevents duplicates to avoid conflicts. Delete the existing one first or use the \"Edit\" function on the existing instance.\n\n- **Q: How do I change the description of a delivery?**\n  A: The description is read-only in the Properties Palette. Right-click the script instance and select \"Edit the current delivery\" to modify the description in the external dialog.\n\n- **Q: The table text is too small/large.**\n  A: Change the \"Dimension style\" property in the Properties Palette to a style with your preferred text height and font settings."

# GE_PLOT_SHOW_NAILING_DESCRIPTION.mcr

## Overview
This script automatically generates text labels in Paper Space displaying the nailing schedule (spacing and nail type) for specific elements. It retrieves engineering data from the model and places it in your layout drawings based on the viewport and zone selected.

## Usage Environment
| Space | Supported | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Model Space | No | The script reads data from here but does not place objects here. |
| Paper Space | Yes | This script must be inserted into a Layout tab. |
| Shop Drawing | Yes | Used for annotating production drawings. |

## Prerequisites
- **Required Entities**: A Layout tab containing a Viewport linked to a valid hsbCAD Element.
- **Minimum Beam Count**: 1 (The selected Element must contain structural members).
- **Required Settings**: The Element must have an attached TSL instance that contains a 'NailingInfo' data map (usually generated by a wall/roof script).

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Launch Script
Command: `TSLINSERT`
Select `GE_PLOT_SHOW_NAILING_DESCRIPTION.mcr` from the file browser.

### Step 2: Pick Location
```
Command Line: Pick a Point To Locate the Description
Action: Click inside the Paper Space layout where you want the nailing label to appear.
```

### Step 3: Select Viewport
```
Command Line: Select a viewport
Action: Click the border of the viewport that displays the wall or floor element you wish to annotate.
```

### Step 4: Configure Properties
After selecting the viewport, the Properties dialog will appear automatically. Adjust settings if necessary and press OK.

## Properties Panel Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Nailing Zone | dropdown | 1 | Selects the specific nailing zone data to display (Range: 1-10). Use different zones if the element has multiple nailing schedules (e.g., zone 1 for perimeter, zone 2 for field). |
| Dim Style | dropdown | *Current* | Selects the Dimension Style to control text height, font, and layer. |
| Offset Between Text Lines | number | 5mm | Sets the vertical distance between the spacing line and the nail type line (if visible). |
| Show Nailing Type | dropdown | No | Toggles the display of the specific nail product code on a second line. |
| Nailing Description Prefix | text | Cladding Nailing: | Custom text added before the spacing values (e.g., "Floor Nailing: ", "Sheathing: "). |

## Tips
- **Updating Text**: If the model changes, simply select the text label and right-click to **Recalc** (or force a recalculation via the hsbCAD menu) to update the values.
- **Missing Data**: If the label displays "N/A", ensure the element inside the viewport actually has cladding or sheets assigned.
- **Zero Values**: If the label shows "0mm" spacing, check that the element has the correct nailing calculation script attached and that the selected 'Nailing Zone' actually contains data.
- **Moving Text**: Use the standard AutoCAD grip at the insertion point to drag the label to a clearer location on the drawing.

## FAQ
- **Q: Why did the text disappear after I deleted the viewport?**
  A: This script is linked to the viewport. If the viewport is removed, the script instance is automatically erased.
- **Q: Can I use this for multiple elements on the same layout?**
  A: Yes, run the script again for each viewport/element combination you need to label.
- **Q: The text is too small to read.**
  A: Change the 'Dim Style' property to a style with a larger text height defined in your drawing standards.

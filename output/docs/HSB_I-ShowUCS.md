# HSB_I-ShowUCS.mcr

## Overview
This script visualizes the local User Coordinate System (UCS) of selected entities to help verify their alignment and rotation in 3D space. It draws colored axis lines (X, Y, Z) originating from the entity's insertion point.

## Usage Environment
| Space | Supported | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Model Space | Yes | Required for visualizing 3D entity orientation. |
| Paper Space | No | Not supported. |
| Shop Drawing | No | Not supported. |

## Prerequisites
- **Required entities**: At least one Entity (Beam, Wall, etc.).
- **Minimum beam count**: 1
- **Required settings files**: None

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Launch Script
Command: `TSLINSERT` → Select `HSB_I-ShowUCS.mcr` from the list.

### Step 2: Select Entities
```
Command Line: Select a set of entities
Action: Click on the beams or elements you wish to inspect. Press Enter to confirm selection.
```
*Note: After confirming, the script will briefly close and automatically recalculate to generate the visualization.*

### Step 3: View Results
The script will generate a triad of axis lines for each selected entity:
- **Red Line**: X-Axis
- **Green Line**: Y-Axis
- **Blue Line**: Z-Axis
Circular markers and text labels are placed at the end of each axis to indicate direction clearly.

## Properties Panel Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | There are no user-editable properties in the AutoCAD Properties Palette for this script. The visualization size is determined by internal script settings. |

## Right-Click Menu Options
| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| N/A | No custom context menu options are provided. |

## Settings Files
- **Filename**: None
- **Location**: N/A
- **Purpose**: N/A

## Tips
- **Color Coding**: Remember the standard color coding: Red is X, Green is Y, and Blue is Z.
- **Checking Orientation**: This tool is particularly useful for checking if a wall is rotated correctly (e.g., ensuring the "top" of the wall points in the correct Z direction) before executing manufacturing or machining scripts.
- **Visibility**: If the generated lines are hard to see against your background color, temporarily change your visual style or background to ensure high contrast.

## FAQ
- **Q: Why does the script seem to disappear after I select entities?**
  - **A:** This is normal behavior. The script operates in two phases: first, it collects your selection, then it restarts in the background to draw the geometry based on that selection.
- **Q: Can I change the length of the axis lines?**
  - **A:** The length is currently hardcoded to a default size (approx. 250mm) within the script. You would need to contact your script administrator to modify the source code if a different size is required.
- **Q: Does this permanently change my drawing?**
  - **A:** The visualization is generated by the script. If you delete the script instance or erase the specific geometry generated by it, the original beams remain unchanged.

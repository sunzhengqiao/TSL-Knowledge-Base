  "documentation": "# HSB_G-TriggerElementTsl.mcr\n\n## Overview\nThis script acts as a remote control for your 3D model, allowing you to send a command signal to a specific TSL script within an Element directly from a 2D Layout. It is typically used to refresh or update specific labels, lists, or graphical data (like an Element Replicator) without manually opening and editing the 3D element properties.\n\n## Usage Environment\n| Space | Supported | Notes |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Model Space | No | This script operates on Layouts. |\n| Paper Space | Yes | This is the primary environment. You must be on a Layout tab. |\n| Shop Drawing | No | Not intended for use within the Shop Drawing context. |\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Required Entities**: A Layout (Paper Space) containing a Viewport that is linked to a 3D Element.\n- **Minimum beam count**: 0.\n- **Required settings**: None. However, the target Element must have the specific TSL script (defined in the properties) assigned to it.\n\n## Usage Steps\n\n### Step 1: Launch Script\nCommand: `TSLINSERT` \u2192 Select `HSB_G-TriggerElementTsl.mcr` from the list.\n\n### Step 2: Select a Viewport\n```\nCommand Line: Select a viewport\nAction: Click on the viewport frame or inside the viewport that displays the 3D element you wish to control.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Select a Position\n```\nCommand Line: Select a position\nAction: Click a location in the Paper Space where you want the trigger label/text to be placed.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Configure Properties\nAfter placement, the Properties Palette will open. Adjust the **Tsl to trigger** and **Execute Key** if the defaults are not suitable for your target element.\n\n## Properties Panel Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| Dimension style text | dropdown | _DimStyles | Select the text style (font, size, color) for the label identifying this trigger in the layout. |\n| Tsl to trigger | text | HSB_E-Replicator | Enter the exact filename of the TSL script attached to the 3D Element that you want to update. |\n| Execute Key | text | setInViewport | Enter the specific command keyword that the target TSL expects to receive to perform the update action. |\n\n## Right-Click Menu Options\n\n| Menu Item | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| setInViewport | Scans the element in the linked viewport for the TSL specified in the properties and sends the command defined in \"Execute Key\" to refresh it. |\n\n## Settings Files\n- No specific settings files are used by this script.\n\n## Tips\n- **Target Accuracy**: Ensure the **Tsl to trigger** name matches the script name assigned to the Element in the 3D model exactly. If the name is wrong, the trigger will fail silently.\n- **Visual Reference**: The script draws text at the selected position in Paper Space. Use this to identify which Viewport and Element the trigger is linked to.\n- **Common Use Case**: This is frequently used to update \"Replicator\" lists on drawings. If you modify the 3D model and want the 2D list to reflect changes immediately, run this trigger.\n\n## FAQ\n- **Q: I right-clicked \u2018setInViewport\u2019 but nothing happened on my drawing.**\n- **A**: Verify that the `tslName` property matches the script name on the element. Also, check if the `executekey` is a valid command recognized by that specific script.\n\n- **Q: Can I move the label text after placing it?**\n- **A**: Yes, you can use standard AutoCAD commands (like `MOVE`) to reposition the text label in Paper Space. This does not affect the trigger's link to the viewport.\n"

# GE_HDWR_GENERIC_CONTAINER.mcr

## Overview
This script acts as a generic launcher that applies a specific hardware or component script to a selected beam. It allows a single catalog entry to dynamically trigger different hardware types based on configuration settings defined in the map properties.

## Usage Environment
| Space | Supported | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Model Space | Yes | This script operates within the 3D model to generate components. |
| Paper Space | No | This script is not designed for layout or detailing views. |
| Shop Drawing | No | This script does not generate shop drawing annotations. |

## Prerequisites
- **Required Entities:** At least one Beam (GenBeam) must be selected before running the script.
- **Minimum Beam Count:** 1
- **Required Settings:** The Macro or Catalog entry calling this script must have a specific string property named `Scriptname` defined in its execution map (e.g., `GE_HDWR_SCREW.mcr`). If this is missing, the script will do nothing.

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Select Beam
```
Action: Select the beam(s) in the model that you wish to apply hardware to.
```

### Step 2: Run Macro
```
Command: Catalog Browser (or execute specific Macro)
Action: Double-click the catalog entry associated with this script.
```

### Step 3: Automatic Execution
```
Action: The script will automatically read the target script name from the map properties, generate the specific hardware on the selected beam, and then remove itself from the drawing.
```

## Properties Panel Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | This script runs once and immediately deletes itself. It does not retain properties in the Properties Palette for editing. |

## Right-Click Menu Options

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| N/A | This script is transient and does not remain in the drawing to offer context menu options. |

## Settings Files
- **Filename**: None
- **Location**: N/A
- **Purpose**: This script does not use external settings files. Configuration is handled via the Catalog/Macro map properties.

## Tips
- **Configuration is Key:** Since this script acts as a container, the behavior is entirely determined by the `Scriptname` setting in the Catalog or Macro definition. Ensure your administrator has configured this correctly.
- **No Trace Left:** After insertion, you will not find a script instance named "GE_HDWR_GENERIC_CONTAINER" in your drawing. You should look for the resulting hardware or component (e.g., a screw or metal plate) that was generated by the target script.
- **Troubleshooting:** If you run the script and nothing happens, ensure the `Scriptname` property in the catalog map matches an existing TSL file in your search path.

## FAQ
- **Q: Why does the script disappear immediately after I use it?**
- A: This script is designed as a "launcher." Its only job is to start the correct hardware script and then get out of the way so the specific hardware script can manage the component.
- **Q: How do I change the hardware type?**
- A: You cannot change it via the Properties palette. You must change the `Scriptname` property in the Catalog or Macro definition, or use a different catalog entry that points to the desired hardware script.
- **Q: I selected a beam and ran the script, but no geometry appeared. Why?**
- A: This usually means the `Scriptname` entry in the map is missing, spelled incorrectly, or the target script file cannot be found. Contact your CAD manager to verify the catalog configuration.

# CE_Cut.mcr

## Overview
This script creates a graphical 3D indicator (arrow and crosshair) to define a specific cut plane location and angle. It stores this cut definition in a data map so that other scripts can apply the cut to timber beams (Parent or Child) within a collection.

## Usage Environment

| Space | Supported | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Model Space | Yes | Used to define cuts in 3D context. |
| Paper Space | No | Not designed for 2D layouts. |
| Shop Drawing | No | Does not generate 2D views. |

## Prerequisites
- **Required entities**: None (Interactive point-based tool)
- **Minimum beam count**: 0
- **Required settings files**: None

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Launch Script
Command: `TSLINSERT` → Select `CE_Cut.mcr` from the file dialog.

### Step 2: Select Insertion Point
```
Command Line: Select Insertion Point
Action: Click in the Model Space to set the origin (pivot point) of the cut.
```

### Step 3: Indicate Cut Direction
```
Command Line: Indicate Cut direction
Action: Click a second point to define the vector/angle of the cut relative to the origin.
```
*Note: An arrow and crosshair will appear to visualize the cut plane.*

## Properties Panel Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Target Beams | dropdown | Child | Determines which beams in the collection are affected by the cut logic stored in this element. Options: Parent or Child. |

## Right-Click Menu Options

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| (None) | No custom context menu items are defined for this script. Standard AutoCAD options apply. |

## Settings Files
- **Filename**: None
- **Location**: N/A
- **Purpose**: N/A

## Tips
- **Adjusting the Cut**: You can drag the origin grip (crosshair) to move the cut location or drag the arrow head to change the angle dynamically.
- **Grip Overlap**: If you accidentally drag the direction grip directly on top of the origin point, the script will automatically snap the direction point 50mm away in the last known direction to maintain the cut definition.
- **Visual Reference**: The arrow represents the direction of the cut, while the circle indicates the rotation/plane reference.

## FAQ
- **Q: Can I use this to physically cut a beam immediately?**
  A: No. This script defines and stores the cut geometry. Other scripts in the collection must read the data generated by this tool to apply the actual machining to the beams.
- **Q: Why did my direction point snap away when I tried to place it on the origin?**
  A: The script requires a distinct direction to calculate a vector. To prevent errors, it enforces a minimum distance between the origin and the direction point.

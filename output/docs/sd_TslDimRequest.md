# sd_TslDimRequest.mcr

## Overview
This script acts as a dimensioning manager for Shop Drawings. It collects dimension requests generated by other attached scripts (TSLs) and transmits them to the shop drawing engine to automatically generate dimensions in layout views.

## Usage Environment
| Space | Supported | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Model Space | No | This script is intended for Shop Drawing generation only and should not be manually inserted in model space. |
| Paper Space | Yes | It functions within the context of generating shop drawing layouts. |
| Shop Drawing | Yes | This is the primary environment where the script executes automatically via rulesets. |

## Prerequisites
- **Required Entities**: An Element (representing the Multipage Sheet) and attached TSL instances (scripts) that contain valid dimension request data (Maps).
- **Minimum Beam Count**: 0 (It processes the Element or attached data, not beams directly).
- **Required Settings**:
    - A configured **MultipageStyle** containing defined Stereotypes for dimensions.
    - **RuleSetData** configured in the entity collector.
    - Attached TSLs must output "DimRequest" map data for this script to find.

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Launch Script
Command: `TSLINSERT` → Select `sd_TslDimRequest.mcr`
*Note: Typically, this script is launched automatically by the Shop Drawing engine based on your Multipage Style configuration, rather than manual insertion.*

### Step 2: Select Entity
```
Command Line: Select entity
Action: Click on the Element (Multipage Sheet) or the construction entity that has the dimension data attached.
```

### Step 3: Define Location
```
Command Line: Insertion point
Action: Click in the drawing to specify the insertion point for the script instance.
```

### Step 4: Configure Properties
After insertion, select the script instance and open the **Properties Palette** (Ctrl+1) to configure which dimensions are drawn and how they are displayed.

## Properties Panel Parameters

### Global Chain Dimension
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Stereotype | dropdown | <Disabled> | Selects the visual style to apply. `*` uses any style, `<Disabled>` hides these dimensions. |
| Direction | dropdown | Default | Sets the reading direction of the dimension text (e.g., Left-to-Right). |
| Side | dropdown | Default | Determines which side of the element the dimension line is placed on. |

### Radial Dimension
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Stereotype | dropdown | <Disabled> | Selects the visual style for radius/diameter dimensions. `*` applies to all curved parts. |

### Local Chain Dimension
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Stereotype | dropdown | <Disabled> | Selects the visual style for local chain dimensions (e.g., stud spacing). |

## Right-Click Menu Options
None.

## Settings Files
- **Configuration Source**: MultipageStyles (Project/Database)
- **Purpose**: Defines the "Stereotypes" available in the dropdown lists. These settings control arrow styles, text height, and layers for the dimensions generated by this script.

## Tips
- **Filtering Views**: Use specific Stereotype names (instead of `*`) to control which dimensions appear on different drawing layouts. For example, use a "Precise" stereotype for detail views and "Standard" for general views.
- **Fixing Overlaps**: If dimensions overlap with geometry or other notes, change the **Side** property (e.g., from "Default" to "Negative View Direction") to flip the dimension line to the opposite side.
- **Reading Order**: If dimension text reads backwards (Right-to-Left), change the **Direction** property to "Positive View Direction".
- **Troubleshooting Missing Dimensions**: If dimensions do not appear, ensure that attached TSLs (like connection scripts) are actually generating "DimRequest" data and that the **Stereotype** filter in this script isn't set to `<Disabled>`.

## FAQ
- **Q: Why don't I see any dimensions even though I inserted the script?**
  - A: Check the **Stereotype** properties in the palette. If they are set to `<Disabled>`, dimensions will be hidden. Also, verify that the Element has other scripts attached to it that provide dimension data.
- **Q: Can I use this to dimension a single beam in Model Space?**
  - A: No, this script is designed specifically for the Paper Space Shop Drawing environment.
- **Q: What does the "*" option in Stereotype do?**
  - A: It acts as a wildcard, allowing the script to process any dimension requests regardless of their specific assigned style name.

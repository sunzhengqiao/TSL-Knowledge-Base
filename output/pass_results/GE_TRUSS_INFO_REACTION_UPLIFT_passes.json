It is designed to quickly verify structural loads for connection design and compliance.\n\n## Usage Environment\n| Space | Supported | Notes |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Model Space | Yes | Script must be run in the model where trusses are located. |\n| Paper Space | No | Not applicable for layout views. |\n| Shop Drawing | No | Not intended for shop drawing generation. |\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Required Entities**: At least one `TrussEntity` (hsbCAD Truss) present in the model.\n- **Component Requirement**: The selected trusses must contain the internal script or component named **\"Alpine-BearingReaction\"**.\n- **Minimum Beams**: 1 Truss Entity.\n\n## Usage Steps\n\n### Step 1: Launch Script\nCommand: `TSLINSERT` → Browse and select `GE_TRUSS_INFO_REACTION_UPLIFT.mcr`\n\n### Step 2: Select Trusses\n```\nCommand Line: Select truss(es)\nAction: Click on one or multiple roof trusses in the 3D model or 2D plan, then press Enter.\n```\n\n### Step 3: View Results\n```\nCommand Line/Log: The script will output the \"Reaction Magnitude\" and \"Max Vertical Uplift\" for each valid truss processed.\nAction: Check the F2 text history window or the command line prompt to read the reported values.\n```\n\n## Properties Panel Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| N/A | N/A | N/A | This script does not use Properties Panel parameters. It runs via command line interaction only. |\n\n## Right-Click Menu Options\n\n| Menu Item | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| N/A | This script does not add custom items to the right-click context menu. |\n\n## Settings Files\n- **Filename**: None\n- **Location**: N/A\n- **Purpose**: This script does not rely on external settings files. It reads data directly from the selected truss entities.\n\n## Tips\n- **Data Availability**: If the report returns no data for a specific truss, ensure the truss was generated or updated with the **Alpine-BearingReaction** calculation component enabled.\n- **Self-Deleting**: This script is a \"query\" tool. It automatically deletes itself from the drawing immediately after running to keep your drawing clean. You do not need to manually erase it.\n- **Batch Processing**: You can select multiple trusses in a single window selection to get a report for all of them at once.\n\n## FAQ\n- **Q: Why does the report say \"Missing Data\" or show no values?**\n  **A:** The selected truss does not contain the \"Alpine-BearingReaction\" script/map. You may need to regenerate or update the truss calculation settings to include this component.\n- **Q: Where can I see the results if they scrolled off the screen?**\n  **A:** Press `F2` in AutoCAD to open the Text Window, where you can scroll up to review previous command line history and reports.\n- **Q: Can I modify the uplift values using this script?**\n  **A:** No, this script is read-only. It only extracts and displays values calculated by the truss generation process."

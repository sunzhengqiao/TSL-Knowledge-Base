The script will verify the installation of the Fastener Manager tool and launch the \"Fastener Manager\" dialog window immediately.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Script Termination\n```\nAction: The script instance automatically removes itself from the drawing after the dialog is launched (or if an error occurs).\n```\n\n## Properties Panel Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| N/A | N/A | N/A | This script does not create persistent entities or expose editable properties. |\n\n## Right-Click Menu Options\n\n| Menu Item | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| N/A | This script does not remain in the drawing to offer context menu options. |\n\n## Settings Files\n- **Filename**: `FastenerManager.dll`\n- **Location**: `%hsbInstall%\\Utilities\\FastenerManager\\`\n- **Purpose**: External .NET Assembly containing the Fastener Manager user interface and logic.\n\n## Tips\n- **Automatic Cleanup**: This script is designed as a \"launcher.\" It will erase itself from the model immediately after opening the dialog. Do not be alarmed if it disappears from the drawing immediately after insertion.\n- **Error Handling**: If the script reports that it cannot find the file, ensure your hsbCAD installation is complete and that the `FastenerManager` folder has not been moved or deleted.\n\n## FAQ\n- **Q: Where did the script go after I ran it?**\n  - A: The script calls `eraseInstance()` immediately upon execution. This is intended behavior; it acts purely as a button to open the external tool.\n- **Q: I get an error saying \"Could not find file\".**\n  - A: This means the `FastenerManager.dll` is missing from the expected directory. Please check your hsbCAD installation path or contact your IT administrator to ensure the Fastener Manager plugin is installed correctly."

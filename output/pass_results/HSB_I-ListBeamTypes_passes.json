It is designed to run once and report this data before automatically removing itself from the drawing.\n\n## Usage Environment\n| Space | Supported | Notes |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Model Space | Yes | The script operates in the current model context. |\n| Paper Space | No | The script does not support Paper Space entities. |\n| Shop Drawing | No | This is not a shop drawing generation script. |\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Required entities**: None.\n- **Minimum beam count**: None.\n- **Required settings files**: None.\n\n## Usage Steps\n\n### Step 1: Launch Script\nCommand: `TSLINSERT` → Select `HSB_I-ListBeamTypes.mcr` from the file browser.\n\n### Step 2: View Results\n```\nCommand Line: [Script executes automatically]\nAction: Observe the text output in the AutoCAD command line (F2) listing the available beam types.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Script Cleanup\n```\nAction: None required.\nNote: The script instance automatically deletes itself from the drawing immediately after generating the report.\n```\n\n## Properties Panel Parameters\nNone. This script does not expose any user-editable properties in the Properties Palette.\n\n## Right-Click Menu Options\nNone. The script executes and terminates immediately upon insertion.\n\n## Settings Files\nNone. This script relies on an internal array rather than external settings files.\n\n## Tips\n- If the list of beam types is long, press **F2** on your keyboard to open the AutoCAD Text Window to view the full history of the output.\n- This tool is useful for developers or advanced users to verify which beam types are currently hardcoded or recognized by the script environment.\n\n## FAQ\n- **Q: Why did the script disappear immediately after I inserted it?**\n  A: This is the intended behavior. The script is designed to output information to the command line and then erase itself to keep the drawing clean.\n- **Q: Where can I find the list of beam types?**\n  A: The list is printed directly to the AutoCAD command line history. Look there immediately after inserting the script."
